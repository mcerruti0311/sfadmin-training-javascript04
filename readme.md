# SfAdmin Training JavaScript Hour 4
## DOM Objects and Built-in Objects

### What You'll Learn in This Hour

* Talking to the user with alert(), prompt(), and confirm()
* Selecting page elements with getElementById()
* Accessing HTML content with innerHTML
* How to use the browser history object
* Reloading or redirecting the page using the location object
* Getting browser information via the navigator object
* Manipulating dates and times with the Date object
* Calculations made easier with the Math object

### Exercise
* Modify Listing 4.2 to output the date and time as a single string, such as:
25 Dec 2011 12:35
* Use the Math object to write a function to return the volume of a round
chimney, given its radius and height in meters as arguments. The volume returned
should be rounded up to the nearest cubic meter.
* Use the history object to create a few pages with their own Forward and Back
buttons. After you’ve navigated to these pages (to put them in your browser’s
history list), do your Forward and Back buttons operate exactly like the
browser’s?
